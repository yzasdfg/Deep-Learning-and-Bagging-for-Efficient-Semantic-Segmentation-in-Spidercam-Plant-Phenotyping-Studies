- Hands-on experience in machine learning (Regression/Classification Algorithms, Ensemble Methods, Clustering, Dimension Reduction, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks), statistical modeling (Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM), Multivariate Analysis, Experimental Design), and data visualization
- Proficient in software and programming tools: Python, R, Tensorflow-GPU on HPC clusters, SAS, SQL 


- Develop a Python APP/GUI for lab scientists to perform data validation for reference stability monitoring studies, which reduces data issues by 80% and speeds up the submissions by 25%. Develop a Python APP to further automate the analysis process, which let the scientists get the analysis report without involving the statistician.

- Perform experimental design and statistical analysis to support: the continued use of the on-market device by validating new calibrations’ linearity, bias, % CV, etc.; the development and performance assessment (sen/spec, etc.) of new devices for launching.

Efficient Labeling for Plant Semantic Segmentation (draft, ongoing)
- Evaluate machine learning and deep learning (U-Net, Deeplab) algorithms for semantic segmentation on UAV ecology images and maize RGB images.
- Develop a novel sample selection method for active learning that achieve satisfactory model performance with 30% fewer labeled samples.
